# neural-collaborative-filtering
NCF, neural collaborative filtering, is a deep learning based framework for making recommendations. Check the follwing paper for details about NCF.

The authors of NCF actually published a nice implementation written in tensorflow(keras). This repo instead provides my implementation written in pytorch. I hope it would be helpful to pytorch fans.
